Description: Mooltipass cross platform daemon/tools
 This project aims to be an easy companion to your Mooltipass device and extend
 the power of the device to more platform/tools. With it you can manage your
 Mooltipass with a cross platform app, as well as provide a daemon service that
 handle all USB communication with the device.
 . 
 This tool is written with a daemon that runs in the background, and a user
 interface app to control your Mooltipass. Other clients could also connect and
 talk to the daemon (it uses a websocket connection and simple JSON messages).
 . 
 The official Mooltipass App only works with Chrome as it relies on USB HID
 library that is only implemented in Chrome. A Firefox (or any other browser)
 extension could easily be written by using the Moolticute daemon.
 . 
 It is completely cross platform, and runs on Linux (using hidraw API),
 OS X (native IOKit API), and Windows (native HID API).
